Abstract
With recent COVID-19, past terrorist attacks including 9/11, Boeing and Airbus planes
successes and difficulties (like the Boeing MAX8), and various strikes both in the past and
gearing up (future possible strikes [none known of as of 2/24/2025]) the team wanted to
know how the bottom lines of airlines are impacted by these factors. The team also wanted
to take into account different airline models and strategies (low-cost and legacy) as each cater
to different audiences when it comes to differences in offerings. Low-cost carriers cater to
the money-tight audiences and family travel while legacy prioritize comfort in travel, luxury
travel, and business travel. There are also differences in fleets and flight routes (domestic
v.s. international) so factors like those also raised questions within the team
